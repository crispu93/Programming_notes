# Agile methodologies
<!-- Based on The Art of Agile Development, 2nd edition-->

## The software crisis
Software projects were:
- Overbudget
- Late
- Didn't meet the requirements
- Canceled

## Response to the crisis
The phase-based approaches:
- Define the requirements
- Desing 
- Implement
- Test
After each phase, everithing would be carefully documented, reviewed, and signed off.

## The Agile Manifesto
*Agile* is three things: the name, the values and the principles. It's a *philosophy*

The values:
1. **Individuals and interactions** over precess and tools
2. **Working software** over comprehensive documentation
3. **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
4. **Responding to change** over following a plan

Agile Development is adaptive rather than predictive; people-oriented rather than process-oriented.
    - Martin Fowler

The principles:
- The highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
- Welcome changing requirements, even late in development.
- Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months.
- Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.
- Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.
- The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face to face conversation.
- Working software is the primary measure of progress.
- Agile process promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to mantain a constant pace indefinitely.
- Continous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.
- Simplicity, the art of maximizing the amount of work done, is essential.
- The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-ornganizing teams.
- At regular intervals, the team reflects on how become more effective, then tunes and adjust its behavior accordingly.

## Adaptive rather than predictive
- **Success** 
    The project is completed on-time and on-budget, with all features and functions as originally specified.
- **Challenged**
    The project is completed and operational but over-budget, over the time estimate, and offers fewer features and functions than originally specified.
- **Impaired** 
    The project is canceled at some point during the development cycle.

If you dont adapt to the change and adjust to a plan, your product might not add much value to the business.
